# Application Security Learning Notes

This repository contains concise, practical notes and writeups created while studying application security vulnerabilities through hands-on labs.

## Focus areas
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- API security
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The goal of this repository is to document security issues clearly, focusing on:
- how vulnerabilities work
- why they happen
- their impact
- how they should be mitigated

These notes prioritize understanding and secure design over exploit novelty.
